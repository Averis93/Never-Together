# Never-Together

"Never Together" is a 2D platformer game in which the player controls the trend of two little-magnets through two different control inputs. Being their advancement automatic, these controls only include the change of polarity of the path surfaces.
Unpredictable explosions will invert the surfaces' controls, allowing the player to use the same inputs used until that moment to control the opposite side. Besides, as you progress in the path, the difficulty will increase with further obstacles and an ever-increasing speed.
